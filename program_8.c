        // In this line, it prints the value of 'i * i - i', followed by a comma and a space.
        // 'i * i - i' calculates the value of (i squared) minus 'i'.
        // '%d' is a placeholder for an integer value (like 'i * i - i') in the formatted string.
        // The actual value of 'i * i - i' is substituted for '%d' when 'printf()' is executed.
